# Cat Scratches App Store Release Kit (February 15, 2026)

## 0) Change Review Since Last App Store Submission (`v2.0.1`)

### User-facing updates included in this submission
- Native macOS app setup screen simplified (single action flow + consolidated Help section)
- Extension settings UI simplified with Basic/Advanced mode and explicit save behavior
- Extension settings language updated to outcome-focused labels ("Where to send clips", "What to capture", "What to ignore")
- iOS app includes updated deep link handling for Safari extension settings on iOS 26.2

### Reliability and migration updates
- Shared extension settings storage module now used by background and settings pages
- Destination selection persistence hardened across updates
- Legacy template migration and token replacement behavior improved
- Selector handling hardened by validating selectors before filter/remove operations
- Selector preview no longer depends on cross-origin fetch from settings page (uses worker-returned HTML)

### Permissions and security posture
- Extension `host_permissions` removed for lower requested permissions
- Extension settings CSP narrowed for `connect-src` to the selector worker endpoint

## 1) Review Findings (Past 3 Days)

### Open finding
- **[P2] Potential migration regression for very old settings payloads**
  - File: `/Users/degner/Documents/GitHub/SafariToDrafts/SafariToDrafts/Shared (Extension)/Resources/defaults.js:369`
  - The current migration path now requires `outputFormat.template` and no longer reconstructs templates from older legacy fields (`customTemplate`, include flags). Users carrying only legacy keys could fall back to the default template.
  - Risk level: medium for long-time users upgrading across multiple old versions.

### Fixed during release prep
- **[P1] macOS app/extension build number mismatch in Release**
  - File: `/Users/degner/Documents/GitHub/SafariToDrafts/SafariToDrafts/Cat Scratches.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:939`
  - `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` for macOS App Release is now aligned to `5`, matching extension build version.
  - Validation: release build warning about `CFBundleVersion` mismatch is gone.

- **[P2] Extension bundle verification script failed for iOS extension bundles**
  - File: `/Users/degner/Documents/GitHub/SafariToDrafts/check_extension_bundle.sh:9`
  - Script now:
    - finds latest extension bundle without project-path filter,
    - supports macOS (`Contents/Resources`) and iOS (bundle root) resource layouts.
  - Validation: script now passes and confirms required files.

## 5) Launch & Growth Plan (Practical)

## 7 days before release
1. Ship a TestFlight build and collect at least 5-10 external tester notes for iOS edge cases.
2. Prepare announcement assets: short demo video, changelog bullets, feature image, website update.
3. Create one focused landing page with App Store badges + direct links.

## Release day
1. Publish iOS first-release announcement + macOS update note together.
2. Post short product demo clips:
   - X / Mastodon
   - Reddit communities related to Drafts, note-taking, and Safari workflows
   - Drafts community/forum channels
3. Use one clear CTA: “Install Cat Scratches for iPhone, iPad, and Mac.”

## First 14 days
1. Track App Store Connect metrics: impressions, product-page views, conversion, retention.
2. Run Product Page Optimization tests on icon/screenshot ordering/copy.
3. Build at least one Custom Product Page tailored to “writers/research” use case and link it from targeted campaigns.

## Messaging angles that should perform
1. “Fastest way to move Safari content into Drafts.”
2. “Works even when Drafts is unavailable (Share Sheet fallback).”
3. “Template + selector control for serious clipping workflows.”
